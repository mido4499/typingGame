# Typing Game

## Description
This is a simple typing game that I developed with my team for a university course. The team has full knowledge that I uploaded the game to Github, and this does not violate the course's policies. The game was initially designed for people with fine motor skills issues, but after developing it, we found that it is fun for everyone. Actually, it is quite addictive. When it was complete, we forgot about the project and started competing in it.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
In terminal, type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mido4499/typingGame
```

2. Open the project's folder in VS Code

3. Make you sure you have "Live Server" extension installed on VS Code. It's free. Navigate to extensions, search for "Live Server", and install it.

4. Right-click "game1.html" file in VSCode Explorer, and click "Open with Live Server".

## Features
1. Visual feedback using photos of cats, score counter, and messages to encorage the user.
2. The game has a very fast rhythm, which is suitable for anyone with a short attention span. 
3. The game gets more difficult, by using more sophisticated words, as the user progresses.

## Technologies used:
1. p5 JavaScript library
2. HTML
